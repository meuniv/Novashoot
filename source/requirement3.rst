Requirement #3: Projectile motion
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
:math:`\boxed{\mathbb{REQ}\Large \rightsquigarrow}` Choose A or B and complete ALL the requirements.
      
A. Simulations. Find and use a projectile simulation applet on the Internet (with your parent’s or guardian’s permission). Then design and complete a hands-on experiment to demonstrate projectile motion.

   (1) Keep a record of the angle, time, and distance.
   (2) How does your horse power compare to the horse power of your favorite car? Graph the results of your experiment. (Note: Using a high-speed camera or
       video camera may make the graphing easier, as will doing many repetitions using variable heights from which the projectile can be launched.)
   (3) Discuss with your counselor:

       (a) What a projectile is.
       (b) What projectile motion is.
       (c) The factors affecting the path of a projectile.
       (d) The difference between forward velocity and acceleration due to gravity.

   Be sure you have your parent’s or guardian’s permission before using the Internet. Some of these websites require the use of Java runtime environments. If your computer does not support this program, you may not be able to visit those sites.

B. Discover. Explain to your counselor the difference between escape velocity (not the game), orbital velocity, and terminal velocity. Then answer TWO of the following questions. (With your parent’s or guardian’s permission, you may wish to explore websites to find this information.)

   (1) Why are satellites usually launched toward the east, and what is a launch window?
   (2) What is the average terminal velocity of a skydiver? (What is the fastest you would go if you were to jump out of an airplane?)
   (3) How fast does a bullet, baseball, airplane, or rocket have to travel in order to escape Earth’s gravitational field? (What is Earth’s escape velocity?)
