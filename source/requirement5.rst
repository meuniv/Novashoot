Requirement #5: Building a machine
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

:math:`\boxed{\mathbb{REQ}\Large \rightsquigarrow}` Choose A or B or C and complete ALL the requirements.

A. Design and build a catapult that will launch a marshmallow a distance of 4 feet. Then do the following:

   (1) Keep track of your experimental data for every attempt. Include the angle of launch and the distance projected.
   (2) Make sure you apply the same force each time, perhaps by using a weight to launch the marshmallow. Discuss your design, data, and experiments—both successes and failures—with your counselor.
       
B. Design a pitching machine that will lob a softball into the strike zone. Answer the following questions, and discuss your design, data, and experiments—both successes and failures—with your counselor.

   (1) At what angle and velocity will your machine need to eject the softball in order for the ball to travel through the strike zone from the pitcher’s mound?
   (2) How much force will you need to apply in order to power the ball to the plate?
   (3) If you were to use a power supply for your machine, what power source would you choose and why?

C. Design and build a marble run or roller coaster that includes an empty space where the marble has to jump from one part of the chute to the other. Do the following, then discuss your design, data, and experiments—both successes and failures—with your counselor.

   (1) Keep track of your experimental data for every attempt. Include the vertical angle between the two parts of the chute and the horizontal distance between the two parts of the chute.
   (2) Experiment with different starting heights for th emarble. How do the starting heights affect the velocity of the marble? How does a higher starting height affect the jump distance?

.. attention:: Once you have completed this requirement, make sure you document it in your worksheet!
