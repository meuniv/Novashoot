.. admonition:: Additional Challenge:

   Can you solve this challenge?
   Two dogs are separated by a 2-mile long straight and flat road. Both start moving at 15 mph toward each other. Before they leave, a fly, which was originally on the head of the first dog, flies away towards the other dog at a constant velocity of 25 mph (this is a very fast fly!). Once it arrives at the second dog, the fly turns around and goes back towards the first dog, still at 25 mph. The fly keeps doing this until the two dogs meet.

   **Question:** What is the total distance the fly flew during this process?
